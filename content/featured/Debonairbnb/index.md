Debonairbnb is a full stack application that allows patrons to book luxurious estates for their next vacation. Patrons can add critiques (commonly referred to as reviews), book charters, and search available estates. The app uses the Google Maps API to display locations of estates and uses Date Range Picker to handle the date ranges of the charters (bookings).
